<p>Welcome to the glossary page.</p>
<ul>
<li>API Server: Control plane component that serves the Kubernetes API.</li>

<li>Cgroup (control group): used to constrain resources that are allocated to processes.</li>

<li>CNI (Container Network Interface)</li>

<li>Control Plane: The container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of containers.</li>

<li>Controllers: Kubernetes controllers handle the desired state of Pods</li>

<li>Container Runtime: the software that is responsible for running containers</li>

<li>CRI (Container Runtime Interface): A plugin interface which enables kubelet to use a wide variety of container runtimes, without the need to recompile.</li>

<li>CSI (Container storage interface): Defines a standard interface to expose storage systems to containers. It is an open standard API that enables Kubernetes to expose arbitrary storage systems to containerized workloads.</li>

<li>GA (General Availability): GA Release version is the final version of a particular product. This release is considered to be very stable and relatively bug-free with a quality suitable for wide distribution and use by end users. </li>

<li>GMSA (Group Managed Service Accounts): provides a higher security option for non-interactive applications/services/processes/tasks that run automatically but need a security credential. It provides automatic password management, simplified service principal name management, and the ability to delegate the management to other administrators across multiple servers.</li>

<li>Job: A finite or batch task that runs to completion.</li>

<li>LTSC (Long term servicing channel): release model where a new major version of Windows Server is released every 2-3 years. Users are entitled to 5 years of mainstream support and 5 years of extended support. This channel is appropriate for systems that require longer servicing options and functional stability.</li>

<li>MIG (Managed Instance Group): a set of VM instances within GCPâ€™s Compute Engine Managed Infrastructure feature. MIGs create VMs based on the assigned instance Template</li>

<li>Nodes: a worker machine in Kubernetes</li>

<li>Node Affinity: allows you to constrain which nodes your pod is eligible to be schedule on, based on labels on the node</li>

<li>Pods: the smallest and simplest unit in Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. It represents a set of running containers in your cluster.</li>

<li>SAC (Semi-Annual Channel): release model where new versions are released twice a year. Users will be supported for 18 months from the initial release. This channel is appropriate for systems that want to innovate quickly and to take advantage of new operating system capabilities at a faster pace, focused on containers and microservices.</li>

<li>Services: A kubernetes service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them - sometimes called a micro-service. You can use services for cross-operating system connectivity. </li>

<li>Taints: allow a node to repel a set of pods (opposite of node affinity). Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node; this marks that the node should not accept any pods that do not tolerate the taints.</li>

<li>Tolerations: are applied to pods. They allow the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints. </li>

<li>Volumes: A kubernetes volume is a directory containing data accessible to the containers in a pod. This allows data to be preserved when a container is restarted or when files need to be shared between containers running together in a Pod. A volume will be destroyed when a Pod is destroyed.</li>
